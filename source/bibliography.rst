   Bibliography
   ============

.. Note that this appears in a chapter named "Bibliography" in the
   LaTeX PDF output, but we don't actually specify that here. The LaTeX
   translator seems to want to collect all references throughout the document
   and consolidate them in a section at the end under that title. Hence the
   chapter is only specified here for html format.

   By convention, add all new bibliography entries here for
   readability of the Specification's source code.
