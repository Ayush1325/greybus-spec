Device Class Connection Protocols
=================================

This section defines a group of Protocols whose purpose is to provide
a device abstraction for functionality commonly found on mobile
handsets. Modules which implement at least one of the Protocols
defined in this section, and which do not implement any of the
Protocols defined below in :ref:`bridged-phy-protocols`,
are said to be *device class conformant*.

.. note:: Two |unipro|\ -based protocols will take the place of device
          class Protocol definitions in this section:

          - MIPI CSI-3: for camera Modules
          - JEDEC UFS: for storage Modules

Loopback Protocol
-----------------

This section defines the operations used on a connection implementing
the Greybus loopback Protocol.  This Protocol is used for testing a
Greybus device and the connection to the device, by sending and
receiving data in a "loop".

The operations in the Greybus loopback Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int ping(void);

    See :ref:`greybus-protocol-ping-operation`.

.. c:function:: int ping(void);

   Sends a "ping" message to the device, from the host, that needs to be
   acknowledged by the device.  By measuring how long this message takes
   to succeed, an idea of the speed of the connection can be made.

.. c:function:: int transfer(u32 len, char *send, char *receive);

   Sends a stream of bytes to the device and receives them back from the
   device.

.. c:function:: int sink(u32 len, char *send);

   Sends a stream of bytes to the device that needs to be acknowledged by the
   device. No data are sent back from the device.

Greybus Loopback Message Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Table :num:`table-loopback-operation-type` describes the Greybus
loopback operation types and their values. A message type consists of an
operation type combined with a flag (0x80) indicating whether the
operation is a request or a response.

Greybus Loopback Ping Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus Loopback Ping Operation is the
:ref:`greybus-protocol-ping-operation` for the Loopback Protocol.
It consists of a request containing no payload, and a response
with no payload that indicates a successful result.

Greybus Loopback Ping Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus ping operation is a simple message that has no response.  It
is used to time how long a single message takes to be sent and
acknowledged from the receiver.

Greybus Loopback Ping Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus ping request message has no payload.

Greybus Loopback Ping Response
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus ping response message has no payload.

Greybus Loopback Transfer Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus Loopback transfer operation sends data and then the same
data is returned.  This is used to determine the time required to
transfer different size messages. To facilitate analysis, the messages
used for both the Loopback Transfer Operation request and response
message have identical formats.


Greybus Loopback Transfer Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Table :num:`table-loopback-request` defines the Greybus Loopback
Transfer request.  The request supplies size of the data that is sent to
the device, and the data itself.

Greybus Loopback Transfer Response
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Table :num:`table-loopback-response` defines the Greybus Loopback
Transfer response.  The response contains the same data that was sent in
the request.

..

Greybus Loopback Sink Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus Loopback sink operation sends data to the device.
No data is returned back.

Greybus Loopback Sink Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus sink request message is identical to the Greybus transfer request
message.

Greybus Loopback Sink Response
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus sink response message has no payload.

Raw Protocol
------------

This section defines the operations used on a connection implementing
the Greybus Raw Protocol.  This Protocol is used for streaming "raw"
data from userspace directly to or from the device.  The data contained
by the protocol is not interpreted by the kernel, but requires a
userspace program to handle it.  It can almost be considered a "vendor
specific" protocol in that the format of the data is unspecified, and
will vary by device.

The operations in the Greybus Raw Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int ping(void);

    See :ref:`greybus-protocol-ping-operation`.

.. c:function:: int send(u32 len, char *data);

   Sends a stream of data from the AP to the device.

Greybus Raw Message Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Table :num:`table-raw-operation-type` describes the Greybus
Raw operation types and their values. A message type consists of an
operation type combined with a flag (0x80) indicating whether the
operation is a request or a response.
